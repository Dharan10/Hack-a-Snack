# 🍪 Hack-a-Snack

A beginner-friendly repository where contributors can add **bite-sized cybersecurity challenges**. Each challenge is designed to be simple, fun, and educational — perfect for people learning **Python + Cybersecurity basics**.

This repo will also serve as a **CTF mini-challenge archive**, and challenges may be reused in CTFs hosted by the maintainer (with credits to contributors).
